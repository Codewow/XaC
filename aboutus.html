                <hr>
                    <p>XaC was formed from the ashes of a short lived but well loved discord server, after the server was abandonned by the owner, I decided to create my own server where fellow Xbox gamers could meet, chat and game together in a relaxed and friendly enviroment. We have over 100 active members from all corners of the world and backgrounds. We hold regular gaming sessions, competitions and the occasional giveaway in which all members can join. We also use a (as far as we know) unique game-tag system that allows you to be notified if members are looking to play a specific game. The server also has a few features designed for fun including a dedicated music channel, our own in-house currency system, gambling and a shop to purchase in server rewards.</p>
